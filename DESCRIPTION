Description: There are a few choices and patterns to building an R package. I have bundled these into a template to try and reflect a starting for my packages.
    This templates aim to cover a setup with roxygen2 auto-documentation, testhat testing, precommit runs for code formating and cleaning, building and including a vignette, a package logo and a package website that should work on github pages.
