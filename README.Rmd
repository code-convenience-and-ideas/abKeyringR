The goal of packTemplate is to build up an example of how I like to build and maintain R packages.

The hope is to integrate the various parts I'd like for ideally having a modern Continuous Integration, Continuous Development (CI/CD) approach to R code.
To that end, I importantly aim to cover:
* Github actions checking the package build
* Automatic testing checks for the code with test packages and coverage checking
* Git pre-commit operations to enforce consistent styles and formatting on the code
* A nice, modern logging approach to 
* Automatic documentation and site building with example of vignettes, new, readmes and a package website.

## Installation

You can install the development version of packTemplate like so:

``` r
# You can install thhis package directly from github
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/code-convenience-and-ideas/packTemplate.git")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(packTemplate)

## basic example code
packTemplate::hello()
packTemplate::df_shape_log_message(cars)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
